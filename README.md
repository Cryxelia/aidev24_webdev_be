## Branch organization
**main** - production environment.  
**dev** - main development branch. Feature branches are merged into this one.  
**"feature-branches"** - developing individual features in isolation that are later merged into dev.

## Pull Request rules
- No merging of branches into main or dev without a pull request.  
- Pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one person before accepting merge into dev.  
- Releases/PR into main is handled under group supervision.  
- Smaller fixes or documentation updates can be made directly into the dev branch.

## Database structure
MongoDB collections:
users - username and password  
paths - Store postion data, title, distance and time for each path. Also contains a refernce to the user_id
Currently implements a validation for the users collection

## Testing procedure
We have implemented E2E tests for some of the core features. For this to work:
- You must have the Backend and Frontend up and running
- While in the root of the Frontend repo folder run the following command: `npx cypress open`
- Navigate to the E2E test selection and just run the test you want to check

## Known bugs
Possible spotify bug:
- One user reported being passed to login after spotify login. Should remain on profile

## Upcoming features
- Community features
